# 🦕 Real-time Hand Detector for Dino Game Control 🖐️

## Description

This repository contains a real-time hand detection and gesture recognition system designed to control the popular Dino game, originally found in Google Chrome's offline mode. Leveraging OpenCV and computer vision techniques, this project enables players to interact with the game using hand gestures captured by a webcam.

## Key Features

- **Hand Detection:** 📷 Utilizes OpenCV for real-time hand detection and tracking from webcam input.
- **Gesture Recognition:** ✋ Implements gesture recognition algorithms to interpret hand gestures as game commands (e.g., jump, crouch).
- **Game Integration:** 🎮 Integrates with the Dino game, allowing players to control the dinosaur character through hand movements.
- **User Interface:** 💻 Includes a user-friendly interface for calibration, sensitivity adjustment, and gesture mapping customization.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (OpenCV, Python).
3. Run the main script to start the hand detection and game control system.
